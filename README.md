# Satellite-Game
This project is a sample for my students in Happy Code School using Unity3D 2018. It tooke me around 10~12 hours to get done. The 3D models were taken from Free 3d models. Feel free to look at the source-code, project, or wahtever you are interested. 

## Getting Started

This project was made in Unity3D 2019.4.14f1. You can just download/clone and open in your Unity Editor. For latest versions of unity, some thing may change.

## Hot to Play 
The game is quite simple: you must push the red orbs (food) to the red container, and the blue orbs (water) to the blue container. If you get the orb in the wrong container, you lose 15 points, and if you lose an orb (push them away from screen) you lose 10 points. If you get negative score, you must revert it till the timer (10 seconds) goes 0, or else, is **Game Over**.
#### Controls
* **WASD/Arrows** - Control the Satellite movement;
* **Q/E** - Control the Satellite Rotation;
* **Spacebar** - Restart Game;
