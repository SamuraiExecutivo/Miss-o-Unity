# Satellite-Game
This project is a (more or less) 14 hours development (one day-work) as a sample for my students in Happy Code School using Unity3D 2018. The 3D models were taken from Free 3d models (priceless). Feel free to look at the source.

## Getting Started

This project was made in Unity3D 2018.3.6f1. You can just download/clone and open in your Unity Editor. For latest versions of unity, some thing may change.

## Hot to Play 
The game is quite simple: you must push the red orbs (food) to the red container, and the blue orbs (water) to the blue container. If you get the wrong orb in the container, you lose Score. If you get negative score, you must revert it till the timer (10 seconds) goes 0, or else, is **Game Over**.
#### Controls
* **WASD/Arrows** - Control the Satellite movement;
* **Q/E** - Control the Satellite Rotation;
* **Spacebar** - Restart Game;
